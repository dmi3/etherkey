Etherkey
========
Emulate a conventional USB keyboard with a scriptable network capable microcontroller.

By using dedicated hardware it is possible to control systems even before the operating system is booted and without being dependent on the running software. For example this allows automatic bootloder selectios or modification of BIOS settings.
